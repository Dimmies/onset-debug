# onset-debug
A debug package made for Onset - https://playonset.com

This package displays IDs for Doors, Objects, Pickups, Vehicles, NPC and Players using WorldToScreen & DrawText.

```
/ddoors - Toggle Door Displays
/dobjects - Toggle Object Displays
/dpickups - Toggle Pickups Displays
/dveh - Toggle Vehicle Displays
/dnpc - Toggle NPC Displays
/dplayer - Toggle Player Displays (Excluding your own)
```

Theres not many use cases for this package, but I figured someone might find it useful in some way.
